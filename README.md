<h1>Aditya Barai | Portfolio</h1>
Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository contains the code and documentation for my personal portfolio, which showcases my work and projects. In this project, Iâ€™ve implemented features to allow users to input data that is stored in a Google Sheet, providing an efficient way to manage and analyze information.

<h3>Features</h3>
* Data Storage: Users can input data directly into the portfolio, which is stored securely in a Google Sheet for easy access and management.
* Gmail Notifications: Receive real-time notifications via Gmail when new data is added or updated, keeping you informed of any changes.
* Dynamic and Interactive: The portfolio is designed to be engaging and interactive, providing a seamless user experience.
<h3>How to Use</h3>
1. Input Data: Users can add data through the user interface, which will then be saved to a connected Google Sheet.
2. Receive Notifications: Stay informed with Gmail notifications whenever new data is added or modified.
